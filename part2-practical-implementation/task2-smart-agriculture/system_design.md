# AI-Driven IoT Smart Agriculture System

## System Overview
An intelligent agricultural monitoring system that combines IoT sensors with AI models to optimize crop yields and resource usage.

## Sensors Required

### 1. Environmental Sensors
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** (Capacitive Sensor) - Monitors water content at different soil depths
- **Temperature/Humidity Sensor** (DHT22) - Tracks atmospheric conditions
- **Light Intensity Sensor** (BH1750) - Measures photosynthetic light levels

### 2. Soil Analysis Sensors
- **NPK Sensor** - Monitors nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
- **pH Sensor** - Measures soil acidity/alkalinity
- **Electrical Conductivity Sensor** - Assesses soil salinity

### 3. Crop Monitoring
- **Camera Module** (Raspberry Pi Camera) - Visual monitoring for pest/disease detection
- **Multispectral Imaging** - NDVI analysis for crop health assessment

## AI Model for Crop Yield Prediction

### Model Architecture
